"""
Make a class called User. Create two attributes called first_name
and last_name, and then create several other attributes that are typically stored
in a user profile. 

Make a method called describe_user() that prints a summary of the userâ€™s information.

Make another method called greet_user() that prints a personalized greeting to the user.

Create several instances representing different users, and call both methods
for each user.

Add an attribute called login_attempts to your User class.

Write a method called increment_login_attempts() that increments the value of login_attempts by 1.

Write another method called reset_login_attempts() that resets the value of login_attempts to 0.

Make an instance of the User class and call increment_login_attempts()
several times. Print the value of login_attempts to make sure it was incremented
properly, and then call reset_login_attempts() . Print login_attempts again to
make sure it was reset to 0.
