'''
Restaurant: Make a class called Restaurant.

The __init__() method for Restaurant should store two attributes:
 - a restaurant_name
 - and a cuisine_type.

Make a method called describe_restaurant() that prints these two pieces of
information, and a method called open_restaurant() that prints a message indi-
cating that the restaurant is open.

Make an instance called restaurant from your class. Print the two attri-
butes individually, and then call both methods.


Three Restaurants: Start with your class from above. Create three
different instances from the class, and call describe_restaurant() for each
instance.
